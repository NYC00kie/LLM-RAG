# LLM-RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation

Documentation has to be added urself.
Just replace the Folder path with ur path.

The docker-compose.yml is for hosting the LLM.
The lLama3.1-RAG-cpu.py or lLama3.1-RAG-gpu.py is for making the vectorestore from the documentation and doing the interaction with the LLM.

(please use a machine with a strong gpu to create the vectorestore, otherwise it takes ages.)
